# $(Third party libraries)

Fuse is working hard to make it possible to reuse exiting JavaScript libraries from third parties. To make more third party
libraries work, we are constantly growing and revising our $(Polyfills) to improve compatibilit.

This chapter contains a list of libraries that are known to work or known to not work, and explains workarounds/caveats.

If you have tested a library and found it to work/not work/a work-around, please share your experience on email to support@fusetools.com.

> This list will be expanded as FuseJS develops.
