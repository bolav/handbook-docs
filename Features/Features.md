## Basic UX Components

Basic UX components are the fundamental building blocks for creating cross-platform app screens. These components work
across all themes, in both `Native` mode and `Graphics` mode. Appearance of certain controls (such as Button) may vary in different
themes.

## Advanced UX Components

These more advanced native components are available in fuse through `Native` theme, or inside a `NativeViewHost`. They are
not available in `Graphics` theme, and can not interact with the Fuse effect system.

Their features, function and appearence may vary between platforms.

## Native Interop

Fuse has several ways in which you can interop with native APIs, existing native code and third-party SDKs.

<table>
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td><b>iOS</b></td>
		<td><b>Android</b></td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
		<td>
			<b>Foreign Code</b>
			<p>Put native Java, Objective-C and C++ code directly in your Fuse project, and expose new functionality to FuseJS.</p>
		</td>
		<td class="feature__planned">In progress (0.10)</td>
		<td class="feature__planned">In progress (0.10)</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>

## Real-time Graphics Effects

Real-time graphics effects takes advantage of Fuseâ€™s powerful Graphics Mode to apply artistic GPU effects to UI elements in real time. This gives designers a new realm of new possibilities to shape visual expressions, animations and transitions. 



<table>
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td><b>Graphics Mode</b></td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
		<td>
			<b>Blur</b>
			<p>Apply real-time blur to any UI element.</p>
		</td>
		<td class="feature__mature">Mature</td>
	</tr>

	

	<tr>
		<td>
			<b>DropShadow</b>
			<p>Put real-time soft drop shadows on any UI element.</p>
		</td>
		<td class="feature__mature">Mature</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
		<td>
			<b>Desaturate</b>
			<p>Put real-time soft drop shadows on any UI element.</p>
		</td>
		<td class="feature__mature">Mature</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
		<td>
			<b>HalfTone</b>
			<p>Applies a configurable halftone pattern to any UI element.</p>
		</td>
		<td class="feature__mature">Experimental</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
		<td>
			<b>Glass</b>
			<p>Apply real-time blur and color grading to the background of any UI element.</p>
		</td>
		<td class="feature__planned">Planned</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
		<td>
			<b>ColorCorrect</b>
			<p>Apply artistic color correction to any UI element in real time.</p>
		</td>
		<td class="feature__planned">Planned</td>
	</tr>
</table>


> Note that GPU effects have a performance cost, and not all combinations and parameters. Applied and configured with care, all effects can be done in smooth 60 FPS even on low end devices. It is not recommended to use effects for essential features in your app, as you may need to disable them on weak devices.

The Fuse effect system is completely general, and you can easily create custom effects with Uno code. Fork one of the existing effects and or extend the Fuse.Effects class to create your own GPU shader effects. 

<table>
	<tr>

			<b>Custom Shader Effects</b>
