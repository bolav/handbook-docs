## Generic UX Components

These UX components are the basic building blocks for creating cross-platform app screens. These components work
across all themes, in both `Native` mode and `Graphics` mode. Appearance of certain controls (such as Button) may vary in different
themes.

## Native UX Components

These components are available in fuse through `Native` theme, or inside a `NativeViewHost`. They are
not available in `Graphics` theme, and can not interact with the Fuse effect system.

Their features, function and appearance may vary between platforms.

## Native Interop

Fuse has several ways in which you can interop with native APIs, existing native code and third-party SDKs.

<table name="nativeinterop">
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td><b>iOS</b></td>
		<td><b>Android</b></td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
		<td>
			<b>Foreign Code</b>
			<p>Put native Java, Objective-C and C++ code directly in your Fuse project, and expose new functionality to FuseJS.</p>
		</td>
		<td class="feature__planned">In progress (0.10)</td>
		<td class="feature__planned">In progress (0.10)</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
		<td>
			<b>Uno Inline Foreign Code</b>
			<p>Implement Uno methods directly in a native platform language: Java, Objective-C or C++.</p>
		</td>
		<td class="feature__planned">In progress (0.10)</td>
		<td class="feature__planned">In progress (0.10)</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
		<td>
			<b>Uno Native API Bindings</b>
			<p>Call any Android and iOS API directly from Uno in plain syntax.</p>
		</td>
		<td class="feature__mature">Mature</td>
		<td class="feature__mature">Mature</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
		<td>
			<b>Uno Extension Layer (UXL)</b>
			<p>Various low-level methods of advanced interop between Uno and the native target language.</p>
		</td>
		<td class="feature__mature">Mature</td>
		<td class="feature__mature">Mature</td>
	</tr>
</table>

## Third-party library wrappers

Fuse will wrap the most popular 3rd party SDKs into easy to use UX/JS APIs. Many third-party JavaScript SDKs will just work as-is.

<b>SDKs and APIs not officially wrapped by Fuse can still be used through <a href="#nativeinterop">Native Interop</a></b>

<table>
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td><b>iOS</b></td>
		<td><b>Android</b></td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
		<td>
			<b>Parse (JavaScript SDK)</b>
			<p>Data, push and analytics for your app through cliend-side JS.</p>
		</td>
		<td class="feature__mature">Works as-is</td>
		<td class="feature__mature">Works as-is</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
		<td>
			<b>Facebook SDK Wrapper</b>
			<p>Basic features from the Facebook SDKs exposed as FuseJS APIs and UX Markup components.</p>

## Real-time Graphics Effects

Real-time graphics effects takes advantage of Fuseâ€™s powerful Graphics Mode to apply artistic GPU effects to UI elements in real-time. This gives designers a new realm of new possibilities to shape visual expressions, animations and transitions. 



<table>
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td><b>Graphics Mode</b></td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
		<td>
			<b>Blur</b>
			<p>Apply real-time blur to any UI element.</p>
		</td>
		<td class="feature__mature">Mature</td>
	</tr>

	

	<tr>
		<td>
			<b>DropShadow</b>
			<p>Put real-time soft drop shadows on any UI element.</p>
		</td>
		<td class="feature__mature">Mature</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
		<td>
			<b>Desaturate</b>
			<p>Fade any element into grayscale as a permanent or transition effect.</p>
		</td>
		<td class="feature__mature">Mature</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
		<td>
			<b>HalfTone</b>

		</td>
		<td class="feature__mature">Experimental</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
		<td>
			<b>Glass</b>
			<p>Apply real-time blur and color grading to the background of any UI element.</p>
		</td>
		<td class="feature__planned">Planned</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
		<td>
			<b>ColorCorrect</b>
			<p>Apply artistic color correction to any UI element in real-time.</p>
		</td>
		<td class="feature__planned">Planned</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
		<td>
			<b>Custom Shader Effects</b>
			<p>The Fuse effect system is completely general, and you can easily create custom effects with Uno code. Fork one of the existing effects and or extend the Fuse.Effects class to create your own GPU shader effects.</p>
		</td>
		<td class="feature__mature">Mature</td>
	</tr>
</table>


> Note that GPU effects have a performance cost, and not all combinations and parameters. Applied and configured with care, all effects can be done in smooth 60 FPS even on low-end devices. It is not recommended to use effects for essential features in your app, as you may need to disable them on weak devices.
