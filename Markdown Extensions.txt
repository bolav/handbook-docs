Handbook markdown extensions

$(Foo) defines where Foo is documented. Any links to Foo will point here.
Note that there can only be one such point in the entire handbook.


Any code in `quotes` or indented blocks should automatically hotlink any words that
are documented.

Regular text can also link to documentation using @(Foo)


$(some-label:Foo bar) defines where "Foo bar" is documented, but you can use label as a
shorthand in references, i.e. 

* @(some-label) - renders <a>Foo bar</a>
* @(some-label: the fancy Foo bar feature) - renders <a> the fancy Foo bar feature</a`>

Note that @(Foo bar) should also work in this case as before.

The links names and labels must not be case sensitve

The following syntax should link to the corresponding Unodoc:

* @unodoc(Fuse.Controls.Button) - renders a recognizeable link button that takes you to unodoc for this thing
* @unodoc(Fuse.Controls.Button: see the full Button reference) - renders <a> see the full Button reference</a>
