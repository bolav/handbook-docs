# $(Uno:Introduction)

While UX and JavaScript is the recommended way of developing apps with Fuse, advanced users can also dive into Uno-code if they want to do more advanced things, like custom rendering. While it doesn't have the live-reload features of JavaScript, and takes a bit of time to set up, it is compiled to native code, and is therefore a nice asset when you need fast custom elements in your UI.
